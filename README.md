# Exploring Machine Learning and Data Science

## Introduction

I am excited to announce that I am currently exploring the fields of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Data Science (DS)**. This journey aims to enhance my understanding of data analysis, predictive modeling, and the application of algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## Goals

- **Learn Core Concepts**: Develop a solid foundation in statistics, data manipulation, and machine learning algorithms.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Work on practical projects to apply theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Familiarize myself with essential tools and libraries, including:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - TensorFlow etc

## Learning Resources

- Online courses (CampusX 100 Days of Machine Learning)
- Books and tutorials on data science and machine learning
- Open-source projects and datasets for practice

## Updates

I will share my progress, insights, and projects as I continue this learning journey. Stay tuned for updates on my exploration of data science and machine learning!
